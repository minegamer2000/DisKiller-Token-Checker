# DisKiller-Token-Checker
this token checker is written in nodejs, meaning it is single-threaded, but this does not mean it is *slow*, it checked 100 tokens in 150ms, this is fast enough for any reasonable person (i hope)

#### Installation
Either:
1. Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Clone.
2. Download and extract [DisKiller-Token-Checker-main.zip](https://github.com/minegamer2000/DisKiller-Token-Checker/archive/main.zip)

#### Starting
Step by Step guide:

1. Open "tokens.txt" and paste your tokens (each token on a new line)
2. Open CMD or the Terminal
3. Use `cd` or `ls` to navigate to the folder (but don't go into /src)
4. Type `node .`
5. The tokens will be checked and the results will be put in a folder.
